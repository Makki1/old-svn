This is a very very early alpha release!

It uses currently only sensor.basic (eib->xPL) and control.basic (xPL->eib) in a very dumb manner, this should be configurable somewhere in the future..
EIB-telegrams are currently treated fixed by their length and the interpreted to the most common datatypes:
- DPT 1 (1 bit, EIS1)
- DPT 5 (8 bit unsigned value, EIS 6)
- DPT 9 (2 byte float value, EIS 5)
- DPT 12 (4 byte unsigned value, EIS 11.000)
- DPT 16 (14 byte character string, EIS 15)
Other DPTs cannot be interpreted correctly or sent right now :oops: 

an xPL message from EIB looks like this:
[code]xpl-trig
{
hop=1
source=wiregate-eibd.wiregate102
target=*
}
sensor.basic
{
device=1/1/254
type=generic
current=1
current_raw=01
}
[/code]

To send something from xPL to EIB something like this:
 xpl-sender -m xpl-cmnd -c control.basic -t wiregate-eibd.HOSTNAME device=1/1/254 type=variable current=22.5 dpt=9
(again, this is less than perfect, no filters yet and I just added dpt to body to avoid creating a separate schema for now)

Values can be read from EIB with 
xpl-cmnd 
sensor.basic 
device=x/y/z (groupaddress)
request=current
Response from EIB comes as xpl-stat

To run one needs xpllib and an xplhub, both also located there as DEBs (both Gerald Dupreys xPL4Linux)
To compile libeibclient-dev from bcusdk/eibd is needed..

Tested under Debian lenny x86, it's likely theres some work to be done for running & compiling it on other platforms..
